This project is just meant to be a small unoriginal platforming game
for me to have fun developing and maybe learn a thing or two! 


Current character drawn (shabbily) by me, will probably redo it in the future.\
I kinda based it of this sprite pack: https://pop-shop-packs.itch.io/frogs-pixel-asset-pack \
which is made by pop shop(?): https://pop-shop-packs.itch.io/ \

## todo:

## logic:
### movement:
1. [ ] respawning
2. [x] collisions (allow for different effects)
3. [x] jump buffering
4. [x] Coyote time
5. [ ] add more types of obstacles
6. [ ] edge-nudging
7. [x] improve jumping with variable jump height and faster falling
8. [ ] apex modifier
9. [ ] tongue pulling

### design:
1. [X] Figure out a way to handle textures (json)
2. [X] Figure out a way to handle levels (binary format)
3. [X] Level-editor

### level-editor:
1. [X] placing things
2. [ ] removing things
3. [ ] undo
4. [ ] redo
5. [ ] moving camera around
6. [ ] layers
7. [ ] scale (slider?)
8. [X] saving levels

## visuals:
### interface:
1. [x] DECIDE UPON A VISUAL THEME: FROG

### camera:
1. [ ] move around
2. [ ] make it damp

#### animations:
1. [X] left and right        
2. [ ] grabbing             
3. [ ] dash                 
4. [x] walk                    
5. [x] jump and fall    
6. [ ] tongue pulling

#### sound:
1. [ ] background  
2. [ ] walk   
3. [ ] dash    
4. [ ] walk        
5. [ ] jump      
6. [ ] tongue pulling

## known bugs:
1. [FIXED] character texture disappears when animation is over for a short time
