This project is just meant to be a small unoriginal platforming game
for me to have fun developing and maybe learn a thing or two! 


Current character drawn (shabbily) by me, will probably redo it in the future.\
I kinda based it of this sprite pack: https://pop-shop-packs.itch.io/frogs-pixel-asset-pack \
which is made by pop shop(?): https://pop-shop-packs.itch.io/ \
